1)Express as Sum Of prime
Write a program in C to check whether a number can be expressed as the sum of two prime. 

Sample Input
Input as: 16
Sample Output
Output :

16 = 3 + 13

16 = 5 + 11
Explanation
-

Note:
Your code must be able to print the sample output from the provided sample input. However, your code is run against multiple hidden test cases. Therefore, your code must pass these hidden test cases to solve the problem statement.

2)Automorphic number
Write a program to check given number is Automorphic number or not.

Sample Input
input =25
Sample Output
25 is Automorphic number.
Explanation
A number whose square ends in the same digits as the number itself. Example : 5,6,25 are automorphic numbers beacause 5*5=25 // last digit is 5 6*6=36 // last digit is 6 25*25=625 // last digits is 25

Note:
Your code must be able to print the sample output from the provided sample input. However, your code is run against multiple hidden test cases. Therefore, your code must pass these hidden test cases to solve the problem statement.

3)All Prime Number
Write a program in C to find the prime Numbers Between the given range 100 to 999
Sample Input
-
Sample Output
-

Note:
Your code must be able to print the sample output from the provided sample input. However, your code is run against multiple hidden test cases. Therefore, your code must pass these hidden test cases to solve the problem statement.

4)Find All Armstrong Number
Write a C program to find all Armstrong numbers between 100 to 999.
Sample Input
153
Sample Output
153 is an Armstrong number because (1)^3+(5)^3+(3)^3 = 153.
Explanation
A three digit number is called Armstrong number if sum of cube of its digit is equal to number itself.

Note:
Your code must be able to print the sample output from the provided sample input. However, your code is run against multiple hidden test cases. Therefore, your code must pass these hidden test cases to solve the problem statement.
5)Strong Number
Write a C program to find all strong numbers between 1 to 500.

Sample Input
input =145
Sample Output
145 is Strong number
Explanation
A Strong number whose sum of each digit's factorial is the number itself. example : 145 is an strong number. Explanation : 1!=1 4!=24 5!=120 So the sum of each digit factorial is 1+24+120 is equal to given input number that is 145.

Note:
Your code must be able to print the sample output from the provided sample input. However, your code is run against multiple hidden test cases. Therefore, your code must pass these hidden test cases to solve the problem statement.
