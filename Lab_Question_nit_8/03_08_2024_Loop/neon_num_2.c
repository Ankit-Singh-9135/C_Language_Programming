// Write a C program that takes a number as input from the user and determine whether the number is a neon number or not. Develop it by using while loop.

// A Neon number is a number is a number where the sum of digits of square of the number is equal to the number itself.

// For Example :

// 9 is a Neon number . Its square is 9*9 = 81 and sum of the digits 8+1 = 9 .So both are equal.

int main(){
int num;
printf("Enter the number ");
scanf("%d",&num);
