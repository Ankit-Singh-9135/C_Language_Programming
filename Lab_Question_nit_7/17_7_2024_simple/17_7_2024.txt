Declare and initialize variables for the following costs:



costPrice: The initial cost of the cycle (Rs. 1200)

repairCost: The cost of repairs (Rs. 250)

coloringCost: The cost of coloring (Rs. 350)

accessoriesCost: The cost of new accessories (Rs. 500)

desiredProfit: The desired profit (Rs. 1500)

2)Surface Area Of Cylinder

Write a C program to find the surface area of a cylinder.Take the height and radius as a input from the user by using scanf().

The surface area of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula:

A = 2PIr^2 + 2PIrh

Find the surface area and print the radius, height and also the surface area.

Enter the radius of the cylinder: 5
Enter the height of the cylinder: 10

Radius: 5.00
Height: 10.00
Surface Area: 471.24

3)Profit and Loss Calculator

You are tasked with creating a C program to calculate the profit and loss for a given transaction using the following formulas. Take the cost price and selling price from the user by using scanf().



Profit (P) = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)

Loss (L) = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)

Profit Percentage (PP) = Profit * 100 / cost Price

Loss Percentage (LP) = Loss * 100 / cost Price

Write a C program that prompts the user for the Cost Price (CP) and the Selling Price (SP) of an item. Calculate and display the profit or loss, as well as the corresponding profit percentage or loss percentage based on the provided formulas.

Your program should:

Prompt the user to enter the Cost Price (CP) and Selling Price (SP) as input.


Calculate the profit (P) or loss (L) based on the given formulas.

Calculate the profit percentage (PP) or loss percentage (LP) based on the given formulas.



Display the calculated profit or loss, as well as the profit percentage or loss percentage.


Read the following input from user

Cost Price: [CP]

Selling Price: [SP]

Profit/Loss: [P/L]

Profit Percentage: [PP]%

Loss Percentage: [LP]%

Cost Price: 1500

Selling Price: 1800

Profit/Loss: [calculatedProfitOrLoss]

Profit Percentage: [calculatedProfitPercentage]%

Loss Percentage: [calculatedLossPercentage]%
