// Develop below program using switch case)

// Write a C program that will read a float and a character from console. The character could be d for deposit or w for withdrawal.

// Starting with a Minimum balance of 2000.



// *Ask the user to initialize the minimum balance and don't allow 0 and -ve values if it is 0 or -ve then print "Ammount Can't be stored".



// *If the user want deposit operation then ask how much ammount he want to deposit and add that ammount

//  with balance and print the balance.

// *if the user want withdrwal operation then ask how much ammount he want to withdrwal and substract that 

//  ammount from the balance and print the balance.



// [Note: If the deposit ammount is negetive or 0 print "Invalid ammount".

//     If the withdrawl ammount is negetive , 0 or greater than balance then print "Invalid ammount"]



// Hints:

// -------

// Declare variables for the amount in float, balance in float and transaction code in char types.



// Test the transaction code, if ‘d’ it is deposit. Test the ammount so that it is not negative.

// If the balance is not negative or positive sum-up

// the balance.

// balance = balance + amount;

// Test the transaction code for withdrawal, ‘w’. If the transaction code is ‘w’

// Minus the withdrawn amount to update the

// balance.

// balance = balance - amount;

// And print the balance.
