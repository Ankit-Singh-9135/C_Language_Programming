Note: only use if statement

1)Even Or Odd Check
Develop a C program that takes an integer input and checks whether it is even or odd. Print "Even" if it's even, and "Odd" if it's odd.

Sample Input
Enter a Integer : 20

Sample Output
Even

2)Find equal or not equal
Create a C program that reads two integers from the user and prints "Equal" if they are equal, and "Not Equal" otherwise.

Sample Input
Enter a number : 10 10

Sample Output
Equal

3)Time Format
Write a C program that takes an hour in the 24-hour format as input and identifies the time of day as "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening," or "Night." Implement this using a series of if statements. Ensure that the program also checks for invalid input, displaying an appropriate message if the entered hour is not within the valid range (0-23). Present the program with a suitable title and header for clarity.

Sample Input
Enter the hour (24-hour format): 13

Sample Output
It's Afternoon.

4)Vowel & Consonant
Develop a C program that reads a character from the user and prints "Vowel" if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u or their uppercase equivalents), and "Consonant" if it's a consonant.

Sample Input
Enter a character : I

Sample Output
Vowel

5)Is Number Divisible ?
Write a C program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.

Sample Input
Enter a number : 55
Sample Output

55 is divisible by both 5 and 11
