1)Bank Account Management
Bank Account Management: Develop a program that simulates a simple bank account system. Users can create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their balances. Implement separate functions for these operations. Take the initial balance as Rs.2000.

Condition : 

For deposit :

* If the user want to deposit 0 or negetive amount then print "Invalid amount to deposit"


For withdraw : 

* If the user want to withdraw 0 or negetive amount then print "Invalid amount to withdrawal"

* If the user given amount is greater than the balance then print "Insufficient Funds"
Sample Input
Deposit Rs.500
Withdraw Rs.3000
Withdraw Rs.1000
Deposit Rs.-200
Withdraw Rs.0
Check balance
Sample Output
Sample Input/Output:
---------------------

Deposit Rs.500
Deposited: Rs.500
Current Balance: Rs.2500

Withdraw Rs.3000
Insufficient Funds

Withdraw Rs.1000
Withdrew: Rs.1000
Current Balance: Rs.1500

Deposit Rs.-200
Invalid amount to deposit

Withdraw Rs.0
Invalid amount to withdrawal

Check balance
Current Balance: Rs.1500

2)Find the Largest Element
Find the Largest Element: Create a program that finds the largest element in an array of integers. Implement separate functions for input, finding the largest element, and main function to displaying the result.
Sample Input
Input as : 

Enter array size : 6

Enter 6 elements : 5 6 3 6 7 9
Sample Output
Output as : 

The largest element is : 9

3)Armstrong number
Write a C program to find all the Armstrong number in beetween 100 to 10000 by using 2 different 

user defined function and one main function to display all the Armstrong number in the given range.
Sample Input
from:100
upto:1000
Sample Output
Armstrong numbers between 100 and 10000 are:

153

370

371

407

1634

8208

9474
Explanation
Armstrong number Example : 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153



4)Swap elements
Program to swap all elements of two integer arrays using user define function in C.
Sample Input
Input as :

Enter array size : 6

Enter 6 elements for 1st array : 1 2 3 4 5 6

Enter 6 elements for 2nd array : 7 8 9 0 1 2
Sample Output
After swapping :

1st array : 7 8 9 0 1 2

2nd array : 1 2 3 4 5 6

5)Amicable Numbers
Write a program to find and display all pairs of amicable numbers within a given range, by using different user defined functions.

Amicable numbers are pairs of numbers where the sum of the proper divisors of one number is equal to the other number.
Sample Input
from:100
upto:10000
Sample Output
Amicable pairs between 100 and 10000 are:

(220, 284)
(284, 220)
(1184,1210)
(1210,1184)
(2620,2924)
(2924,2620)
(5020,5564)
(5564,5020)
(6232,6368)
(6368,6232)
